 # Ollama UI App

Welcome to the Ollama UI App! This application is designed to provide a seamless user experience on macOS, utilizing the power of SwiftUI. To fully utilize the capabilities of our app, you'll need to install the Ollama CLI and ensure it is running before using this client. Here's how to install the Ollama CLI through Homebrew:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Run the following command to install Homebrew if not already installed:
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
3. Install Ollama CLI using Homebrew:
   ```
   brew install ollama
   ```
4. Verify the installation by running `ollama --version`. You should see a message showing the installed version of Ollama CLI.

Now that you have installed Ollama CLI, ensure it is running before using the client app. To run the Ollama CLI, open Terminal and type:

```
ollama start
```

Once the Ollama CLI is running, you can use the Ollama UI App without any issues. I am very glad to see that you are interested in contributing to this open-source app! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug reports, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
